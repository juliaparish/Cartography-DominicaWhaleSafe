## Motivation
The Worthwhale MESM group project (Bren School class of 2020) performed an economic valuation of whale watching tourism in Dominica (do-mi-NEE-ka), a Caribbean island nation. They found that:
* Whale watching tourism comprises a nontrivial fraction of Dominicaâ€™s GDP.
* Whale habitat and marine traffic spatially overlap.
* Interactions between whales and fast-moving ships pose a threat to whales and thus have negative impacts on whale watching tourism.
* A vessel speed reduction zone may ease stress on the local whale population.

## Usage
A critical part of this evaluation was determining the spatial footprint of the speed reduction zone and its impact on marine traffic adjacent to Dominica.

## Homework Assignment Task

This assignment's goal was to create a method to determine the outline of the speed reduction zone and its effect on the local marine traffic. The speed reduction zone should encompass the preferred habitat of the local sperm whales, which you will approximate as areas of frequent whale sightings.
